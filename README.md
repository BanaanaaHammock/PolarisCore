TODO: Everything.

Going to move and re-organize all the code from the PolarisServer project and get it to work with .NET core for 
multi-platform shenanigans.

develop should be where all the untested (but compileable) code, file PRs to this

master should be where all tested/stable/no warning code goes, don't commit here directly, merge changes from develop
